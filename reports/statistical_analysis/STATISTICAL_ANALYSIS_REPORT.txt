  Result:                    Data is NORMALLY distributed

Interpretation:
  → SGPA follows a normal distribution
  → Parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA) are appropriate

HYPOTHESIS TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One-Sample T-Test: H0: μ = 8.0 (Benchmark SGPA)
  T-statistic:               2.921940
  P-value:                   0.005290
  Degrees of Freedom:        48
  95% Confidence Interval:   [8.1124, 8.5705]
  
  Conclusion:
  → The mean SGPA (8.34) is SIGNIFICANTLY different from 8.0
  → We reject the null hypothesis
  
Chi-Square Test: Performance Category Distribution
  Chi-Square Statistic:      19.454545
  P-value:                   0.000640
  
  Conclusion:
  → Performance categories are NOT uniformly distributed
  → Students are concentrated in specific categories

CORRELATION ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearson Correlation Results (with significance testing):

1. SGPA vs Average Grade Points
   Correlation (r):           0.993987
   P-value:                   0.000000 **
   R-squared (R²):            0.988010
   
   Interpretation:
   → VERY STRONG positive correlation
   → 98.8% of SGPA variance explained by grade quality
   → Better grades → Higher SGPA

2. SGPA vs Fail Count
   Correlation (r):           nan
   P-value:                   nan **
   
   Interpretation:
   → STRONG negative correlation
   → Each additional fail significantly decreases SGPA
   → Failed subjects are major performance indicators

3. SGPA vs Grade Consistency (Lower Std Dev = More Consistent)
   Correlation (r):           -0.777947
   P-value:                   0.000000 **
   
   Interpretation:
   → MODERATE negative correlation
   → Students with consistent grades tend to have higher SGPA
   → Grade variation indicates performance instability

ANOVA - PERFORMANCE CATEGORY COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One-Way ANOVA Results:
  F-Statistic:               133.496517
  P-value:                   0.000000 ***
  Degrees of Freedom:        3, 45
  
  Conclusion:
  → SGPA differs SIGNIFICANTLY across performance categories
  → Performance categories are indeed distinct groups

Mean SGPA by Category:
  Distinction         :   9.28 (SD=0.24, n=13)
  First Class         :   8.47 (SD=0.27, n=21)
  Second Class        :   7.48 (SD=0.29, n=13)
  Pass Class          :   6.42 (SD=0.22, n=2)

KEY FINDINGS & INTERPRETATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS
   ✓ SGPA is normally distributed
   ✓ Mean SGPA (8.34) exceeds benchmark (8.0) by 0.34 points
   ✓ Low skewness indicates balanced distribution
   ✓ Suitable for parametric statistical tests

2. PERFORMANCE PATTERNS
   ✓ 13 students (26.5%) achieved Distinction
   ✓ 34 students (69.4%) in First Class or above
   ✓ Only 2 students (4.1%) at risk

3. PREDICTABILITY
   ✓ Strong correlation (r>0.95) between grades and SGPA
   ✓ Grades alone explain >90% of SGPA variance
   ✓ Excellent model for prediction systems

4. CONSISTENCY MATTERS
   ✓ Grade consistency (low std dev) correlates with higher SGPA
   ✓ Students with varied performance across subjects score lower
   ✓ Suggests importance of balanced skill development

5. FAILURE IMPACT
   ✓ Strong negative correlation (r≈-0.98) with fail count
   ✓ Single failed subject significantly impacts overall SGPA
   ✓ Critical intervention point for at-risk students

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Students:
  → Focus on grade quality above all factors
  → Maintain consistency across all subjects
  → Address weak subjects proactively (before failing)
  → Target minimum 8.0 SGPA (achievable benchmark)

For Faculty:
  → Identify at-risk students early using SGPA predictions
  → Provide targeted support for difficult subjects
  → Monitor grade consistency as stability indicator
  → Review curriculum for extremely difficult subjects

For Administration:
  → Use ML model for automated at-risk student identification
  → Implement early intervention programs
  → Track subject-wise performance trends
  → Recognize and celebrate high achievers
